**Things to research -** 
 - What do we use oil for
 - Why are we using foreign oil
 - Do we refine oil domestically
 - Can we self sustain our own oil supply
 - How much is spent on foreign oil
 - How much does the economy depend on oil
 - Do we have any control over the pricing of foreign oil
 - What is the plan of action if we cut off foreign oil supply
 - Can we change energy creating types
 - How will this affect foreign relations / trade relations

**Current reliance on foreign oil**  
 - [How much oil consumed by the United States comes from foreign countries?](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=32&t=6)
In 2022, U.S. crude oil production equaled about 11.883 million barrels per day (b/d), crude oil imports equaled about 6.278 million b/d, and crude oil exports equaled about 3.604 million b/d, with net crude oil imports equaling about 2.674 million b/d.

**Why are we using foreign oil?**

- [We produce enough crude oil, but why do we import it ?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/america-produces-enough-oil-to-meet-its-needs-so-why-do-we-import-crude)
1. That happens because of a combination of economics and chemistry. The economics are simple: overseas oil, even after shipping costs, is often cheaper than domestically-produced crude.
2. You see, the U.S. does produce enough oil to meet its own needs, but it is the wrong type of oil.Crude is graded according to two main metrics, weight and sweetness. The weight of oil defines how easy it is to refine, or break down into its usable component parts, such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. Light crude is the easiest to handle, heavy is the most difficult, with intermediate obviously somewhere in between. The sweetness refers to the sulfur content of unrefined oil. The sweeter it is, the less sulfur it contains.  

**U.S. Oil Production**  
[Where does domestic oil come from?](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/oil-and-petroleum-products/where-our-oil-comes-from.php#:~:text=Where%20U.S.%20crude%20oil%20is,production%20came%20from%20five%20states.&text=In%202021%2C%20about%2015.2%25%20of,of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico.)  
The top five crude oil-producing states and their percentage shares of total U.S. crude oil production in 2021 were:
- Texas: 42.4%  

- New Mexico
11.1%
- North Dakota
9.9%
- Alaska
3.9%
- Colorado
3.7%
- In 2021, about 15.2% of U.S. crude oil was produced from wells located offshore in the federally administered waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
